# SatML Website

This is a draft version of the SatML landing page, styled with a green/tech vibe to match our AI/climate mission.

The current version includes:

- Updated hero section + CTA  
- Rewritten copy (problem + mission)  
- Floating elements and thematic colors  

I'm treating this purely as a draft and open to any suggestions or tweaks. Next steps I'm planning include:

- Smooth scroll transition into section 2  
- Cleaning up the emoji system  
- Adding more project-specific visuals (e.g. satellite data, model architecture)
